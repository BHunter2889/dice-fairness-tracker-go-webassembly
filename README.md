# Dice Fairness Analyzer
- This is an experiment with Go & WebAssembly using Vugu, 
a Vue API based framework for creating components.

### Support
- Currently this only supports tracking a single 20 sided die (d20) in a static context.
- Support for die with a variety of other sides to be added as most of the logic plumbing is in place.
- For now, to reset the counters, simply reload the page.

### Deployment
- Currently this is deployed with Heroku at:
